# Introduction

This site is a reference for standard Ethereum wallet JSON-RPC methods, giving developers a consistent interface that any EIP-compliant wallet should implement.

## What is an Ethereum wallet?

An [Ethereum wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) is an application that gives users control over their Ethereum account — it acts as both a gateway to the network and a tool for managing digital assets and identity. Wallets don’t store funds themselves; instead, they provide an interface for interacting with accounts on the blockchain.

From a developer’s perspective, wallets expose three core functionalities through their RPC interface:

### Authenticate Users

Wallets handle identity and account management, allowing applications to:
- Access account information such as onchain address and balance
- Request user information such as contact & shipping information
- Request permissions to sign messages and transactions on a user's behalf

### Send Transactions

Wallets handle the entire transaction lifecycle:
- Validate and populate transaction parameters
- Present human-readable details for user approval
- Sign the transaction with the user’s private key
- Broadcast the transaction to the network

### Sign Messages

Applications can request offchain signatures over arbitrary data:
- Prove account ownership
- Sign structured messages that can be relayed onchain to modify state
- Create verifiable attestations

## EIP-1193: Ethereum Provider JavaScript API

[EIP-1193](https://eip.tools/eip/1193) defines a JavaScript API that Ethereum wallets expose to web applications. This standard ensures a consistent interface across wallet providers, allowing developers to write code that works with any compliant wallet.

Unless otherwise stated, the documented methods refer to those submitted via the standard [EIP-1193](https://eip.tools/eip/1193) provider interface.

### The Provider Interface

Wallets expose an `ethereum` object in the browser’s global scope that implements the EIP-1193 interface. Its `request` method is the primary way to interact with the wallet:

```javascript
// Basic request
const result = await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
  params: []
});
```

All requests follow the same shape:

1. **method** – a string identifying the RPC method
2. **params** – an array of parameters required by the method
3. **return value** – a Promise that resolves to the method’s response

```javascript
// Example: sending a transaction
const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'eth_sendTransaction',
  params: [{
    from: '0x…',
    to: '0x…',
    value: '0x…',
    gas: '0x…'
  }]
});
```
